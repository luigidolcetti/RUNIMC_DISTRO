\description{
An IMC analysis is composed of few objects contained in the IMC_Study
\strong{currentAnalysis} and a corresponding sub-folder of the study folder.
\code{\link[=newAnalysis]{newAnalysis()}} create an empty analysis structure both in the specified
study IMC_Study and on disk, essentially overwriting the analysis object
but keeping the file structure, so a previous analysis can always be loaded
as current via the \code{\link[=retrieve]{retrieve()}} method.
